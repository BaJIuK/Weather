 

Weather
=======

Android small weather application. It was given to me like “test application”
for entering some startup. I have decided to use and learn “Conductor” android
framework. Application handles exceptions \\ device rotations \\ permissions. It
correctly handles save \\ restore after being killed.

 

Features:
---------

1.  Get weather in current place (Using latitude and longitude)

2.  Get weather in some city (There is a dialog to enter city name)

3.  Save cities in database locally (ORM)

4.  User can navigate through saved cities (I have made it with the help of
    TabLayout)

 

Frameworks and methods used:
----------------------------

-   Dagger 2

-   ButterKnife

-   RxJava

-   Retrofit

-   **Conductor**

-   Reactive-Location

-   RxPermissions

-   MVP

 

Future plans:
-------------

-   Add ability to remove location
